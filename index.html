        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After working as an athletic trainer in the healthcare and fitness industries for the last 15 years, I decided it was time to try something new.  My husband and I moved to the area a year and a half ago from near the Twin Cities, and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to come back to school with FVTC being so close.  I'm in my second semester of the Web Development and Design program, and am really enjoying my classes!</p> 
        <p>I enjoy all things health and wellness-related, and teach several fitness classes at multiple locations all over the Fox Cities.  In the summer I spend a lot of my time in Fremont skiing with the Webfooters Water Ski Show Team, and in the winter months, my husband and I participate in a beginner league at the Appleton Curling Club.</p>
